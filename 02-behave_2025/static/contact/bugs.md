## Errors, bugs and suggestions

Although we hope that you will never encounter errors or bugs, we know that sometimes they happen.
In that case we invite you to report them to us, so that we can solve them for you and other users.

Any issues you encounter, as well as any suggestions you may have, you can either [report through GitHub](https://github.com/behave-app/behave/issues), or email us on behave-app@claude.nl.

If you want to share large files that are too big to attach / email (e.g. your issue is specific to your video file), let us know and we can provide you with an upload link.
